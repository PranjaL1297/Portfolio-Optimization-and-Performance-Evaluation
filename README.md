# üìä Portfolio Optimization and Performance Evaluation ‚Äì JNJ & CSX Analysis

This project was part of our group coursework for the module on Capital Market Instruments. It focused on applying **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and **CAPM-based analysis** to evaluate the investment potential of two prominent US-listed companies: **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** and **CSX Corporation (CSX)**.

## üîç Objective

The primary aim of the project was to:
- Construct the **investment opportunity set** for a portfolio of two risky assets
- Identify and compute the **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)** and the **Tangency Portfolio**
- Create the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)** using a risk-free asset
- Perform **CAPM regression**, estimate **betas**, and calculate **Jensen‚Äôs alpha**
- Analyze the **risk-return characteristics** and suggest a better stock from an investor's perspective

---

## üßæ Data Used

- Daily adjusted closing prices of **JNJ** and **CSX** over the **last 5 years**
- Market returns approximated using **S&P 500 Index** as a proxy
- **Risk-free rate** assumed based on short-term U.S. Treasury yields
- Data was processed in **Excel**, including return calculation, regression analysis, and portfolio simulation

## üß† Key Questions Answered

1. **What are the annualized returns and risks (standard deviations) of JNJ and CSX?**

2. **How correlated are the two stocks? What does this mean for diversification?**

3. **How does the efficient frontier behave when combining JNJ and CSX in various proportions?**

4. **What are the weights, return, and risk of the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)?**

5. **How is the Tangency Portfolio constructed? What are the optimal weights?**

6. **How does the Capital Allocation Line (CAL) look when combining the tangency portfolio with a risk-free asset?**

7. **What are the beta values of JNJ and CSX? Are they aggressive or defensive stocks?**

8. **How do JNJ and CSX perform relative to the CAPM expectations via Jensen‚Äôs Alpha?**

9. **Which stock is a better investment based on the above analysis?**

## üìå Summary of Findings

- **JNJ** displayed **lower volatility** but **modest returns**, indicating a defensive profile.
- **CSX** had **higher returns** but came with **greater risk**, aligning with a more cyclical, growth-oriented asset.
- The **Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP)** favored a higher allocation to JNJ due to its stability.
- The **Tangency Portfolio**, which maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, showed optimal diversification benefits from both assets.
- Beta values were within expected ranges:
  - **JNJ Beta < 1** (defensive)
  - **CSX Beta > 1** (aggressive)
- **Jensen‚Äôs Alpha** for both stocks was positive, indicating potential overperformance relative to the CAPM-predicted return.
- The **CAL** provided a framework for constructing investor-specific portfolios depending on their risk aversion.
